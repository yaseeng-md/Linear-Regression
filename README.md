Hey Learners,
Two files have been created on the same dataset
1. Cretaed a Linear regression model from Scratch
2. Created a Linear Regression model from Sklearn

Note :
1. Do not forget to install the required libraries or else you will end up getting errors

follow the commands below : 
If you are using a command prompt for installing libraries 
"""
pip install numpy
pip install pandas

If installing the packages in the notebook, Add "!" in front of pip
